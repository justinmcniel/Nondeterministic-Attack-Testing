This project is being done for fun as part of some ongoing research into nondeterminability of various ciphers.
Currently it only tests AES, and as expected, no significant insights are found as of yet.
The basic idea is that it's possible to not know the value of a bit, so we simply mark it as such, proceed, and try to see just how much information we can still know for sure at various points.
All code and the idea for this is my own, but I also have not searched to see if anyone else has done research into this before.
